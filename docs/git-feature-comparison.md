> **STATUS: 🟡 NEEDS UPDATE (reviewed 2026-06-06).** Re-baseline parity status; fix dead `/Desktop/Editors/{zed,vscode}` paths (now under `references/`).

# Git Feature Comparison

This compares the current Platform Git implementation with Zed at
`/Users/shaul/Desktop/Editors/zed` and VS Code at
`/Users/shaul/Desktop/Editors/vscode`.

The main target is feature parity with Zed. VS Code is treated as a second pass
for useful extras once the Zed-level workflow is covered.

## Current Platform Implementation

Status: implemented enough for a basic Git panel and diff review.

- Repository detection for a selected workspace path via `git rev-parse`.
- Repository metadata: branch, commit, ahead count, behind count, root path.
- File status from `git status --porcelain=v2 -z`, including modified, added,
  deleted, renamed, untracked, ignored, and conflicted.
- Status decorations in the file tree.
- Git panel with staged and worktree groups.
- Stage, unstage, and discard one file or a group of files.
- Working tree and staged diffs.
- Untracked file diffs using `git diff --no-index /dev/null <path>`.
- Rename and deletion diff snapshots.
- Blob-backed snapshot diff documents, so an opened diff remains stable after
  the index or worktree changes.
- Split/unified diff display through `@singapor/diff`.
- Inline changed-word highlighting in diff rows through `annotateInlineChanges`.
- Previous/next hunk navigation in opened diff views.
- Commit from the panel with a single-line message.
- Empty-message commit request opens `COMMIT_EDITMSG`, but saving that file does
  not yet complete or abort the commit.
- Branch list, checkout, and create branch.
- Fetch, pull, and push using Git defaults.
- Backend `apply-patch` endpoint can apply patches to the worktree or index, but
  there is no hunk/selection UI using it yet.

Important current limits:

- No hunk-level stage, unstage, or restore UI.
- No blame, file history, commit graph, or timeline.
- No stash support.
- No branch delete/rename, remote management, tags, merge, rebase, or cherry-pick.
- No Git merge conflict resolution UI.
- No worktree support.
- No clone/init flow.
- No integrated Git authentication/askpass flow.
- No binary diff handling.
- No settings surface for Git behavior.

## VS Code Nice-To-Have Checklist

These are not required for Zed parity, but they are useful ideas from VS Code's
Git extension.

### Repository And SCM Platform

| Feature                                      | Why It Matters                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public source-control provider API           | Lets extensions or internal tools contribute SCM providers and actions. |
| Multi-repository source control view         | Better support for monorepos, nested repos, and multi-root workspaces.  |
| Open/close/reopen repositories               | Lets users hide noisy repositories without disabling Git globally.      |
| Parent-folder repository detection prompt    | Useful when opening a subfolder inside a repo.                          |
| Repository scan settings and ignored folders | Avoids expensive scans in `node_modules` or generated trees.            |
| Status limit warnings                        | Protects the UI from huge repos with tens of thousands of changes.      |
| Optimistic updates                           | Makes stage/unstage feel immediate while Git catches up.                |
| Git output/log panel                         | Essential for debugging failed commands.                                |
| Progress and cancellation support            | Important for clone/fetch/push/pull/stash on large repos.               |

### Staging And Discarding

| Feature                                               | Why It Matters                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Stage all tracked changes                             | Faster than selecting changed tracked files manually. |

| Stage all merge changes                               | Specific workflow during conflict resolution.         |
| Stage selected ranges                                 | More precise than hunk staging.                       |
| Stage hunk/block and stage selection from diff gutter | High-value review workflow.                           |
| Revert selected ranges                                | Complements partial staging.                          |
| Clean all tracked/untracked separately                | Safer bulk discard options.                           |
| Discard untracked changes to trash                    | Safer than immediate delete.                          |
| Close diff on operation setting                       | Keeps review tabs tidy after stage/discard.           |

### Commit Workflow

| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Commit all                            | One-command tracked-change commit.                  |
| Commit staged                         | Explicitly commits only staged changes.             |
| Empty commit                          | Useful for CI retriggers and markers.               |

## Suggested Platform Milestones

1. Close the high-value Zed panel/diff gaps:
   - Hunk and selected-range stage, unstage, restore.
   - Git panel tree view, status/path sorting, diff stats, conflict section.
   - Safer discard flows: tracked restore vs untracked trash.

2. Add Zed-level repository workflows:
   - Branch delete/rename, remote branches, remote selector.
   - Fetch from remote, pull rebase, push to remote, set upstream, force push.
   - Init and clone.

3. Add review/history features:
   - Git gutter.
   - Inline blame and full blame action.
   - File history and commit diff view.
   - Project Diff or multi-diff all-changes review.

4. Add interruption and recovery workflows:
   - Stash list/apply/pop/drop and stash diff.
   - Merge conflict region parsing and resolution buttons.
   - Uncommit/amend/signoff.

5. Add larger repo/platform features:
   - Multi-repository discovery and active repo selection.
   - Worktrees.
   - Commit graph and commit search.
   - Hosting providers, line permalinks, create pull request.
   - Askpass/auth integration.

6. Consider VS Code extras after Zed parity:
   - Sync/publish branch, fetch prune, push tags/follow-tags.
   - Smart commit, no-verify commit, commit validation, post-commit command.
   - Merge/rebase/cherry-pick commands and abort flows.
   - Source-control provider API.
   - Repository scan limits, progress/cancellation, and Git output logging.
