> **STATUS: 🟢 CURRENT (written 2026-08-10).** Living plan. Companion analysis: [editor-parity-gap-matrix.md](editor-parity-gap-matrix.md) — every non-have row there is assigned to a wave here. The beyond-parity vision layer lives in [editor-1000-parity-plan.md](editor-1000-parity-plan.md) (this plan is its dimension D1). Supersedes the stale sections of `git-feature-comparison.md`, `command-palette-vscode-parity-backlog.md`, and `vscode-keymap-development.md` where they disagree (corrections listed in the matrix).

# Editor Mode Parity Plan — VS Code / NeuralInverse / Athas

Target: our editor mode reaches feature parity with **all** features of the three references — VS Code (`f321c7605d4`, 2026-08-10), NeuralInverse (`2d68ded2f2b`, 2026-07-22), Athas (`2c25c47b`, 2026-06-16), all pinned at upstream HEAD in `references/`.

Scoreboard after a verified sweep of 448 features: **80 have · 109 partial · 259 missing**, plus 11 cross-cutting areas (encodings, untitled buffers, file-op undo, Emmet, commenting, bulk edit, custom editors, deep links, …). "All" is honest scope: with everything included this is a multi-year program for one implementer. The wave order below is chosen so value density falls monotonically — stopping after any wave leaves a coherent product.

## Where we stand

**At or beyond parity already:**

- The editing core fundamentals: piece-table document model (fuzz-tested, ~0.6ms/keystroke at 1M lines), durable anchors, multi-cursor, find/replace, folding, virtualized rendering, minimap, diff engine (split/stacked, word-level, live projection), merge-conflict editing. Athas's in-house engine is experimental (they default to Monaco) — **our core beats theirs**.
- The agent runtime: event-sourced orchestration, checkpoints with revert, worktree sessions, approvals, plan mode, session rail. VS Code's Aug-2026 agentHost/agentSessions work is **converging on what we already built**; NeuralInverse's equivalent services are less production-grade than ours.

**The three deficit bands:**

1. **Typing assistance** — auto-close, auto-indent, snippets, signature help, suggest filtering/docs. This cluster is what makes an editor feel finished, and it is almost entirely missing.
2. **Workbench shell** — one editor group, no splits, no status bar, narrow settings, no chords. Deliberately modest so far; recent investment went to chat-mode.
3. **Whole subsystems** — debug, testing, tasks, notebooks, extensions marketplace, database client, GitHub integration: greenfield.

**Three structural findings that shape everything below:**

- **The server is ahead of the client.** The native TS session already answers signatureHelp, rename, codeAction, documentSymbol; the stdio proxy passes any LSP method through; the git service has applyPatch, branches, worktrees, file-at-ref with no UI consumers. Many "missing" features are client-UI-plus-wiring, not full-stack builds.
- **The engine has ready seams.** Typed registries (blocks, injected rows, inline replacements, gutters, highlighters, decorations) mean CodeLens, inlay hints, ghost text, sticky scroll, quick-diff, breakpoints have rendering hosts waiting. Data is even pre-computed in places (tree-sitter worker already ships bracket ranges with zero consumers).
- **PLAN.md is the spine.** The 12-week state-correctness roadmap (WorkspaceDocumentService, FileSyncService, CommandBus, FocusService, LspService) is a prerequisite, not a competitor: splits, chords, when-clauses, changesets, workspace problems all land **on those seams**. Do not build parity features on the current React-effect wiring that PLAN.md is scheduled to delete.

## Shared substrates (build once, unlock many)

The critic pass found the same infrastructure hiding inside dozens of feature requests. Each substrate is listed in the wave where it lands; violating this list means five features each half-build the same thing.

| #   | Substrate                                                                                                          | Unlocks                                                                                                                | Wave |

## The waves

Effort letters from the matrix: S = days, M = 1–2 wk, L = 3–6 wk, XL = multi-month. Every wave ends with typecheck/tests green and the app usable (same gate discipline as PLAN.md).

### E0 — Unwired wins (~2 weeks total; everything here has its data or engine code already built)

> **Status: 8 of 11 landed** — bracket matching, word wrap, go-to-line, occurrence highlighting, document links, signature help, compare-with-saved, open-file-at-ref. Committed in both repos with tests; the highlighters, links, compare-with-saved, and open-at-ref were verified in the running app. Remaining: expand/shrink selection (re-rated, see below), markdown preview, AI commit message.

- ✅ **Bracket-match highlight + jump-to-bracket** — the worker's bracket ranges had no consumer past `syntaxController`; `brackets` now reaches `EditorViewSnapshot` (gated by the folds coverage check) and `bracketMatchPlugin` paints the pair. `editor.action.jumpToBracket` on `Mod+\` — VS Code's `Mod+Shift+\` is unavailable because the hotkey layer refuses Shift+punctuation as layout-dependent. Matching validates characters rather than trusting the worker's `depth`, which collides on unbalanced text (`{ a ]`).
- ✅ **Word wrap** — `wordWrap` in EditorOptions, `setWordWrap`/`isWordWrapEnabled`, and `editor.action.toggleWordWrap` on `Alt+Z`.
- Expand/shrink selection — tree-sitter helpers exist; wire commands + keybindings. (S) — _still open: the helpers are async and need the tree-sitter backend, so this is a plugin, not a command alias._
- ✅ **Go to line/column** — `:line[:column]` quick-access mode, navigating through the same `openDefinition` path the `@` symbol mode uses.
- ✅ **Passive occurrence/word highlight** — scans only the mounted rows the snapshot carries, so it never materializes the document; whole-word matching reuses `wordRangeAtOffset`.
- Signature help — server handlers already answer; reuse markdown-tooltip infra for the widget. (S) — _still open: needs a controller inside `lsp-plugin/plugin.ts` (it requires the LSP client), unlike the standalone view-contribution plugins above. `createTooltipController` is the reusable widget._
- ✅ **Document links** — http(s) URLs underlined, Cmd/Ctrl+click to open; viewport-scoped, narrow matching, keeps a `)` the address itself opened.
- Markdown live preview — engine package built; add to platform plugin list. (S) — _blocked on adding `@singapor/markdown` as a web dependency, which touches the bun-link/turbo-cache setup._
- ✅ **Compare with Saved** — a `compare-saved:` document kind diffing the live buffer against disk, both sides read live so the diff keeps updating as you type. In the editor context menu. _Revert file, compare-with-clipboard, and select-for-compare remain open; revert also needs the undo-history hazard resolved (see the text-menu note)._
- ✅ **Open file at ref** — `git-ref:` document kind + "Open File at HEAD". Read-only by construction: the content lands in an _unsynced_ document, which the save path and the file-backed guards both refuse, because the editor has no read-only flag.
- AI commit message — sparkle button over the orchestration runtime we already run. (S)

### E1 — Typing assistance (the "feels finished" wave)

Substrate S4 first, then:

- Auto-closing pairs, type-over, surround-with-brackets, auto-delete pair (M/core)
- Auto-indent on Enter via tree-sitter indentation queries (M/core)
- Indentation commands: convert tabs/spaces, detect-from-content, reindent (S)
- **Snippets engine** — tab stops, placeholders, choices, variables; flip `snippetSupport: true` so LSP completions stop being flattened (L/core)
- Suggest-widget upgrade: client-side fuzzy filter/rank, docs flyout, `completionItem/resolve` (unblocks auto-import on typescript-language-server), themed icons, word-based fallback, commit characters (M/core)
- Bracket-pair colorization + colored indent guides variant (M)
- Line-op extras: sort/join/duplicate-selection/transpose/case transforms (S)
- Word-part (camelCase/snake_case) movement/selection/delete (S)
- Column (box) selection (M); cursor undo (S); selection anchors (S)
- Clipboard extras: copy-line-when-empty, per-cursor paste spread, copy-with-highlighting (S)
- Unicode highlighting (confusables/invisibles) + unusual-line-terminator warning (M)
- Rulers, font zoom, middle-mouse scroll, in-place value cycling, empty-buffer placeholder, overtype mode, read-only message, cursor style options (each S/niche)
- Find-in-buffer perf debt: move to piece-walker + worker (from TODO.md) so find stops materializing full text (M)

### E2 — Language intelligence completion

Substrates S3, S5, S12 first — S12 means landing the PLAN.md LspService with multi-server-per-document (eslint + ts concurrently, provider merging). Then:

- Formatting: document/range commands, default-formatter pick, **format-on-save + save participants** (trim trailing, final newline — the "file hygiene" items), format-on-type (M total)
- Rename with prepare + inline widget + multi-file preview via S5 (L→M once S5 exists)
- Code actions: lightbulb, Cmd+., refactor/source menus, fix-all + organize-imports on save (L→M via S5)
- Workspace symbols — `#` palette mode (M)
- Semantic tokens layered over tree-sitter coloring (M)
- Inlay hints (inline-replacement seam) (M); CodeLens (injected-row seam) (M)
- Color decorators + picker (M); linked editing (M); smart paste/drop providers (M/niche)
- Real peek views via S3 (references/definition embedded editor) + marker peek with related info; diagnostic tags (fade/strikethrough) + relatedInformation rendering (M)
- Sticky scroll (top-block seam + scope data) (M)
- Outline sidebar view + breadcrumbs strip with symbol trail (M each; breadcrumbs also satisfies Athas/shell entries)
- Call hierarchy (L), then type hierarchy reusing its shell (M)
- Folding extras: LSP foldingRange fallback, `#region`, fold-all-by-level/comments/imports (S)
- Emmet — expansion, wrap, balance (M; critic addition, daily expectation for a web-dev IDE)
- Language mode picker + automatic detection + file associations + status-bar entry (M; critic addition)
- Hover polish: sticky/focusable hover, diagnostics merged into hover (S)
- Editor accessibility pass 1: screen-reader strategy decision, accessibility-help dialog, tab-focus-mode toggle (start of the XL retrofit — see Dispositions)

### E3 — Workbench shell structure

Substrates S1, S2, S7, S10 (CommandBus + FocusService weeks of PLAN.md land here if not already done). Then:

- **Editor groups**: split right/down, 2D grid, drag between groups, split-in-group, maximize, even-sizes, locked groups, per-group history (L)
- Pinned tabs + preview tabs + open-editors limit; tab sizing modes (M)
- **Status bar** with the full entry set (M — strip + entries; sources exist)
- Editor navigation history: back/forward across files, last-edit-location, Ctrl+Tab MRU overlay (M)
- Command palette upgrade on S10: MRU ranking, preserve-input, disabled reasons, virtualization, `%` quick text search (M)
- Quick open: MRU/frecency ranking (Athas fff-search idea), open-to-side, `:line` suffix chaining (M)
- **Keybindings**: chords, when-clause contexts, conflict reporting, precedence; keybindings-editor search/record/conflict UI; keymap import (VS Code json) (L)
- **Settings platform**: configuration registry (defaults, user/workspace scopes, JSON, live reload, per-language overrides) + full settings editor UI (search, categories, modified indicators) + import/export/reset (L) — absorbs Athas's 15-tab surface and NI's settings pane
- Themes: registry + live-preview picker + high-contrast + **custom theme install**; file-icon themes (M)
- Notifications center: history, DND, progress notifications, status-bar bell (M)
- Secondary sidebar (right dock) (M); activity-bar badges/reorder/hide (S); bottom-panel maximize/move/align (S)
- Menu bar: full File/Edit/Selection/View/Go categories over the declarative menu model; title-bar command center + layout toggles (M)
- Window management: zoom commands, new-window/duplicate, confirm-before-close polish (M)
- Zen mode + centered layout + banner + screencast mode + layout reset commands (S each)
- Keyboard navigation everywhere: tree type-ahead, roving tabindex, focus outlines (M, rides FocusService)
- Welcome/walkthrough system (fold NI onboarding wizard + Athas onboarding; include provider setup + theme pick) (M)

### E4 — Files & workspace robustness (critic-heavy wave)

- **Encodings**: detection, reopen/save-with-encoding, BOM handling, EOL display + CRLF/LF convert, binary-open guard — fs service is hardcoded utf8 today; this silently destroys non-UTF-8 files (M/core)
- **Untitled editors**: Cmd+N scratch buffers, save-as flow, language pick, paste-into-new-editor (M)
- **Auto-save** (afterDelay/onFocusChange/onWindowChange) + **hot exit** (backup dirty buffers incl. untitled, restore on crash/reload) — replaces the current "block on beforeunload" model (M/core)
- **File-op undo + trash**: delete-to-OS-trash with restore, undo rename/move/create/delete, explorer cut/copy/paste, OS-file drop-import, Reveal in Finder (M)
- Update-imports-on-move via LSP `fileOperations` (S once S5 exists)
- **Local history** (per-save snapshots) merged with **Timeline view** (file history — uses S9) (M)
- Large-file debts from TODO.md: streaming/windowed load, tombstone GC, tree-sitter WASM ceiling (L)
- S11 substrate + **image viewer** as first consumer (clicking a PNG currently opens nothing) (M)
- OS integration: app protocol handler / deep links (file:line, project, chat session), open-in-external-terminal (S)
- EditorConfig support (S)
- Multi-root workspaces (L/niche — schedule last in wave or defer; worktree sessions already cover the main monorepo use case)

### E5 — Git & SCM parity

Substrate S9 (one `git log`-backed endpoint unblocks four features). Then, roughly in dependency order:

- Branch picker (server API exists, zero UI): checkout, create-from, delete/rename, detached, recent-commit metadata; status-bar branch/sync entry (S–M)
- Commit box: multiline editor, validation, history navigation, amend/signoff/no-verify/commit-all/empty, undo-last-commit, COMMIT_EDITMSG completion, smart-commit, action button (M)
- **Hunk/range staging** — server applyPatch is ready; diff-gutter buttons + selected-range staging (M/core)
- **Quick-diff gutter** in normal editors (live vs HEAD/index) + peek widget with stage/revert from peek (M/core — engine liveProjection + canvas gutter unused today)
- Editable diff (working-tree side live in diff editor) (M)
- Blame: inline EOL decoration, hover with commit details, status-bar item (M)
- History: **source control graph view**, commit details as multi-file diff, incoming/outgoing (L over S9)
- Multi-file diff editor — generalize the existing chat thread-diff document (M)
- Stash (full lifecycle), tags, remote management, auto-fetch, publish/set-upstream, force-push-with-lease, pull-rebase/prune options (M total)
- Merge/rebase/cherry-pick/revert with abort/continue; conflicts SCM group; accept-both/accept-all + compare in inline conflict flow; **3-way merge editor** (L)
- Clone / init / publish repo; askpass/SSH auth bridge; checkout safety (auto-stash); branch working sets; submodules (M–L)
- Multi-repository support (L)
- Worktree UI in the workbench git panel (endpoints + chat-mode consumers exist) (S)
- Polish: changes tree-view toggle, SCM badge, git palette command set (rides S1/S10), git settings page (rides E3 settings), .gitignore action, hosting-provider links (open-on-GitHub/permalink/create-PR), image diff, status-model fidelity, diff options toggles, moved-code detection (last), history-item-as-chat-context (S)

### E6 — Terminal, tasks, problems, output, search polish

- Terminal **multi-instance + tabs + splits + profiles** — server is already multi-session-keyed; this is client UI over the panes package (M)
- Find-in-terminal (needs ghostty-web scrollback search API) (M)
- **Shell integration** (OSC 133/633): command decorations, rerun/run-recent, cwd detection — highest-leverage terminal investment; unlocks sticky scroll, quick fix, command navigation (L)
- Terminal in editor area; font/settings surface; send-sequence/auto-replies/bell; accessibility buffer; image protocols (investigate ghostty-web support) (M–L)
- **Tasks system**: tasks.json v2 core, run-task quickpick, terminal execution, rerun-last, Cmd+Shift+B defaults; npm-script auto-detection; **problem matchers** ($tsc, $eslint-stylish) feeding S8; background/watch tasks with dependsOn; folder-open tasks; absorb Athas "run actions" (L+L)
- Problems panel on S8: workspace-wide aggregation, filters (text/severity/glob/active-file), related info + clickable codes, table view, tree/tab error badges (M)
- Output channels: per-LSP-server stderr, task output, log-level control (M — our Logs panel stays the structured superset)
- Search polish: inline replace preview (old→new), preserve-case global replace, dismiss-result, open-to-side, tree/list toggle, search-editor context lines + `.code-search` persistence, `%` quick text search if not in E3 (M)
- Simple browser / web-viewer tab (S)

### E7 — AI editor integration (the differentiator — can start in parallel after E2)

We already lead on the runtime; this wave closes the gap where **NeuralInverse and VS Code lead: AI woven into the editor surface itself**. Substrate S6 first.

- **Ghost-text inline completions** on S6 → **FIM autocomplete service** (prefix/suffix windows, import injection, AST context — NI's design; BYOK model routing) → **Next Edit Suggestions** (gutter arrows, jump hints, rename propagation) (L → L → XL, strictly in that order)
- **Inline chat (Cmd+K/Cmd+I)**: zone-widget prompt over selection, streamed in-place diff, accept/discard/rerun; selection helper widget; editor AI actions (explain/fix/review, fix-this-diagnostic); terminal inline chat (L + S + M + M)
- **Changesets over open buffers** on WorkspaceDocumentService + S5: live streamed edits into editors, per-hunk/per-file keep/undo, editor overlay with prev/next + N-files progress, auto-accept setting — merges NI fast-apply + VS Code chatEditing (L)
- Code-block actions: smart apply-to-editor, insert at cursor, run/insert in terminal, save-to-file (M)
- Context breadth: implicit active-file/selection with toggle, symbol/folder/problems attachments, screenshots (M)
- Conversation UX: edit-and-resubmit + fork, message queueing + mid-turn steering, follow-up suggestions, ask/edit-only modes, export/import, quick/side/detached chat, subagent drill-in rendering, chat request inspector (S–M each)
- **Approval rules**: persistent per-tool/per-command-pattern auto-approve, risk tiers with command parsing, project-level agent config file, global YOLO setting (M — merges VS Code risk service + NI `.neuralinverseagent`)
- **MCP**: server management (config file + schema, start/stop, logs, OAuth, gallery/discovery import) + chat runtime integration (tool confirmations, prompts as slash commands, resources as attachments, elicitation) (L + M — platform has zero MCP surface today)
- Customization: instructions files with applyTo globs, prompt files with front-matter, custom modes, hooks management UI, AI-customization hub, agent plugins/store + built-in agent library (NI), agent memory tools, tool sets picker (M each, hub L)
- **Context engine**: hybrid retrieval (BM25 + trigram + embeddings + import graph + context packer) exposed as agent tools + AI section in search view (L — NI's strongest unique idea)
- **Workflow automation**: file-glob/schedule/terminal-exit triggers + approval-gated orchestrator; visual composer later (L + L)
- Agent surfaces: agent manager window, parallel sub-agent UI, agent-owned named terminals, artifacts pane (S), image carousel (S), voice dictation + agent launcher (L/niche)
- Local model management (Ollama pull/list/auto-setup) + direct BYOK provider loop breadth (~21 providers) + auto model selection (M + L + M)
- Cloud/background remote coding agents (XL — after the local story is airtight)

### E8 — Debug & testing

- **DAP client core** behind the Bun server (spawn adapters like the LSP proxy; vscode-js-debug first) (XL)
- launch.json flow + config dropdown + debug quick access; preLaunchTask via E6 tasks (L)
- Breakpoints: gutter toggle/drag, verified states, breakpoints view; conditional/hit-count/logpoints/inline/triggered; function/exception/data (L + M + M)
- Execution control toolbar; call stack view + current-line decorations; variables (set value, visualizers); watch; **debug console/REPL** (L + L + L + M + L)
- Debug hover, inline values (inline-replacement seam), exception widget, status indicators (rides S2), JS auto-attach + debug terminal (M each)
- Loaded scripts (M/niche), disassembly + memory inspection (L/niche, last)
- **Testing** (best effort-to-value in this wave — Vitest is the house runner): controller/discovery model, test explorer, run/debug/coverage profiles, **continuous run on FileChangeHub**, gutter run buttons + state icons, failure peek with expected/actual via our diff engine, results panel with ANSI output, coverage view (L + L + M + M + M + M + M + L)

### E9 — Viewers, ecosystem & verticals (each item is a deliberate go/no-go)

- Viewers on S11: PDF, hex/binary, CSV table, image editor (resize/convert) (M each)
- **Database client** (Athas's biggest unique surface: connection manager, schema browser, data grid CRUD, SQL console; per-provider sidecars → our Bun server processes) — GO, it fits the server architecture (XL)
- **GitHub integration**: PR list/viewer + review comments (needs the critic's commenting-threads substrate: range-anchored threads on zone widgets + comments panel + provider API), issues, Actions runs, create-PR (L + L)
- **Vim mode** built-in (operators/motions/text-objects/registers/command bar/jump list) (L)
- Extension ecosystem decision: keep first-party typed registries as the plugin story now; third-party marketplace/isolation is XL and deferred until demand is real. Athas-style **AI extension generation** is the interesting middle path — generate + install into our registries (M investigate)
- Remote: productize the client/server split (connect-to-remote UX, TLS, host management — our web architecture gets this nearly free); ports view later; SSH auto-provisioning after (M + L)
- Collaboration (Athas channels/chat/screen-share): NO for now — different product; revisit if multiplayer becomes a goal (XL)
- Notebooks: NO for now — the uniform-row virtualizer fights cell UI; revisit only with a data-science push (XL)
- Compliance pillar (NI Checks/Enclave): adopt the **Enclave-lite slice only** — outbound prompt secret/PII scanning + immutable AI action log; skip the framework engine (M vs XL)
- Settings profiles + settings sync (needs an account/backend story first) (L + XL, deferred)
- Accessibility retrofit: dedicated program for screen-reader mode, accessible views (editor/terminal/diff/chat), audio signals (XL — tracked, scheduled after E3 gives it chrome to attach to)
- Localization/i18n framework (L/niche, deferred)

## Dispositions — consciously declined or N/A (so nothing is silently dropped)

- **Print** — N/A (VS Code has no built-in print either).
- **Telemetry opt-out surfaces** — N/A (we collect none; keep it that way; a privacy note in settings suffices). Athas/NI product-metrics services: not adopted.
- **Quota/entitlement/plan-signup flows** — N/A (BYO-provider platform).
- **Fork auto-update channel** (NI) — N/A (web-delivered; clients always load the deployed version).
- **UI restyle/branding** (NI styleOverrides) — have by construction (our design system is fully custom).
- **OSS/weak-model enhancement pipeline** (NI) — N/A (our providers are tool-native agent CLIs).
- **editSessions cloud transfer / authentication / share permalinks** — declined until any cloud story exists.
- **Process explorer / issue reporter / performance tooling** — declined; the Logs panel exceeds this for our needs.
- **Enterprise policy service / managed mode** (NI + Athas) — declined for a single-user product.
- **Remote tunnels** — declined (requires a hosted relay service).
- **Firmware dev environment / Legacy modernisation** (NI) — declined; vertical-market products, not editor parity.
- **Notebook-scoped search, notebook AI** — follow the notebooks no-go.
- **floatingMenu** — optional polish, folded into E2 code-actions UX. **symbolIcons** — folded into suggest-widget theming (E1).
- **Middle tier oddities**: buffer carousel (Athas novelty) — skip; chat pet — skip (with regret).

## Sequencing summary and effort shape

| Wave | Theme                   | Rough size                      |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| E0   | Unwired wins            | ~2 wk                           |
| E1   | Typing assistance       | ~2 mo                           |
| E2   | Language intelligence   | ~3 mo                           |
| E3   | Workbench shell         | ~3 mo                           |
| E4   | Files robustness        | ~2 mo                           |
| E5   | Git parity              | ~3 mo                           |
| E6   | Terminal/tasks/problems | ~2.5 mo                         |
| E7   | AI editor integration   | ~4 mo (parallelizable after E2) |
| E8   | Debug & testing         | ~4 mo                           |
| E9   | Viewers & verticals     | ~4 mo of GOs                    |

Dependency spine: PLAN.md services → E0 anytime → E1/E2 (need S3/S4/S5/S12) → E3 (needs CommandBus) → E5/E6 ride E3's palette/status-bar/settings → E7 rides E2's edit substrate + S6 → E8 rides E6 tasks + S2 → E9 rides S11. E4 is independent and can interleave anywhere after E0. Where the user-visible payoff must come first, run E0+E1 before finishing the PLAN.md weeks — they touch the engine, not the state seams.

Every wave should keep the two ours-only differentiators alive and untouched: the decode open animation and in-buffer markdown live preview — no reference has either.
