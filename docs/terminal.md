# Terminal processes and transport

Platform's terminal service uses [`@workspace/pty`](../packages/pty/README.md) directly. Each
terminal shell is a child of the Bun server process. The Node bridge, embedded bridge script,
and `@lydell/node-pty` dependency have been removed.

## Ownership

[`TerminalService`](../apps/server/src/terminal/service.ts) owns one session per worktree and
terminal ID. It keeps shell selection, environment, dimensions, reconnect policy, session logs,
and the worktree execution lease. The package owns the native subprocess and PTY descriptors.

The service installs the output callback during spawn and observes the package's `exited`
promise. That promise waits for the direct child and terminal output to finish. Shutdown first
records the termination request, then asks the package to terminate, and waits for completion
and the durable lease to end. The package escalates to `SIGKILL` after 250 ms when necessary.

A rejected completion promise does not prove process exit. The service records
`terminal.session.ownership_unconfirmed`, closes the client, and retains the execution lease.
Successful completion releases ownership only after the lease end transaction succeeds.
Neither the package nor the service supervises a whole descendant process tree.

## Wire format

The `/terminal` WebSocket uses binary frames for input and output. Text frames carry JSON
controls: client `resize` and `dispose`, server `ready`, `exit`, and `error`. The
[contract parsers](../packages/contracts/src/terminal.ts) distinguish these by frame type, so
binary content that looks like JSON remains terminal data.

The web client forwards Ghostty's byte input directly and feeds received bytes to
`Terminal.write`. Deliberate text commands are UTF-8 encoded at the command boundary. Terminal
sockets use `binaryType = 'arraybuffer'`. Binary input bypasses Eden's JSON encoder; server
output uses a Buffer view because Elysia would JSON-encode a plain Uint8Array.

Detached sessions stay alive for ten minutes. Reconnection sends `ready` and replays the final
256 KiB as raw byte chunks. The cap also applies to an individual oversized output chunk. A
failed client send detaches that client without terminating its PTY.

## Verification

On 2026-09-06, the production service passed the same integration smoke check on Linux x64 and
macOS 26.4 arm64 with Bun 1.4.0. It verifies three shells directly parented by Bun, Ctrl-C/D,
resize, an exact 2 MiB binary echo, the final 256 KiB replay, and Neovim alternate-screen entry,
resize to 117 × 37, edit/save/exit. Disposal leaves no direct children and ends all three leases.

The smoke check drives the real service routes in-process with an isolated workspace and an
in-memory lease boundary. Focused server tests separately drive the real orchestration database
to verify durable ownership, exit ordering, and persistence retries. Client tests exercise the
binary protocol and the existing socket adapters.

```sh
bun run --cwd apps/server test src/terminal/tests/service.test.ts
bun apps/server/scripts/pty-smoke.ts
bun apps/server/scripts/pty-benchmark.ts
```

The smoke check requires `nvim`, POSIX `sh`, and `stty`. The benchmark measures the production
service without opening a socket. It excludes network transport, rendering, and orchestration
persistence. Before and after measurements on the same Linux Intel Core i7-14700K host were:

| Measurement                | Node bridge | Native service |
| -------------------------- | ----------: | -------------: |
| Startup median, 20 samples |   17.228 ms |       0.736 ms |
| Startup p95                |   19.505 ms |       0.792 ms |
| Echo median, 100 samples   |  0.05523 ms |     0.01447 ms |
| Echo p95                   |  0.08169 ms |     0.02224 ms |

Both returned all 6,400 measured payload bytes. The native service carries those bytes without
JSON envelopes. On the Mac, native startup median was 20.674 ms and echo median was 0.01850 ms;
no Mac Node baseline was measured. These are service measurements, not end-to-end UI timings.

The package requires Bun 1.3.14 or later; the repository pins 1.4.0. Windows is completely
untested, with compatibility unknown. The current package guard permits Linux and macOS only.
