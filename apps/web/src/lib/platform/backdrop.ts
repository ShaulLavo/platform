 * What is behind the page.

 * - `app` — nothing is. A browser on a desktop that hands each window an opaque
 *   rectangle, and the shell while its window is opaque on such a desktop: the
 *   web layer draws the wallpaper and paints the solid floor.
 * - `compositor` — the window is opaque, but the window manager composites it
 *   over the real desktop and fades or blurs it there. Linux out of the box,
 *   for a shell window and a browser tab alike. The floor stays solid — an
 *   opaque window has to paint one — and a wallpaper of ours would only cover
 *   up the user's.
 * - `transparent` — the window itself is see-through, so the desktop is behind
 *   every translucent pane. No wallpaper, and no floor: painting one would hide
 *   exactly what the transparency is for. Only a shell can arrange this.
