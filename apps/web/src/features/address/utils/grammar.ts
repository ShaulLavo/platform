 * Since every tab token is already a `/`-joined list of individually encoded segments,
 * that escaping cost three characters per separator and turned a readable token into
 * `f%2Fapps%2Fweb%2Fsrc%2Fmain.tsx` — measured at 25% of the whole param on a
 * twelve-tab workspace.
 *
 * Reading it back has a trap, and it is why this cannot simply drop the encoding and
 * keep using `params.get`. That getter percent-decodes once, and the decode is
 * currently absorbed by `set` having escaped `%` as `%25` on the way out. Remove the
 * outer layer and a file named `a~b.ts` — encoded `a%7Eb.ts` — decodes back to a
 * literal `~` BEFORE the split, silently becoming two tabs. So the value is split
 * first and decoded per segment afterwards, exactly as `parseAddress` already treats
 * the path, for exactly the same reason.
