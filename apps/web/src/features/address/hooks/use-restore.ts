 *
 * Everything is applied through domain actions in slot order — workspace, mode,
 * document, panel — never through raw setters. Three consequences: the URL cannot
 * express invalid state; the applier inherits the existing supersede protocol rather
 * than competing with it (`useOpenWorkspaceRoot` still arbitrates which project
 * switch won); and panels go through the store's own setter, which normalizes, so the
 * store can never end up claiming a file is selected while the editor pane shows
 * nothing.
 *
 * On BOOT an absent field means "defer to the remembered slice", never "reset to
 * default", so a short link lands somewhere sane instead of flattening everything it
 * does not name. On POPSTATE the address is authoritative — it is one this app wrote —
 * so an absent field means the default, and back is the inverse of forward.

 * them would be redundant at best. `boot` also never CLOSES a tab, because the address
