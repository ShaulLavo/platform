/**
 * The `textDocument.semanticTokens` block this app declares to one server.
 *
 * **Its only input is the server id.** Not the document, not the root, not the
 * viewport, not a setting read at call time — and that signature is the
 * invariant rather than a simplification.
 *
 * The reason is pooling. `initialize` is sent **once per pooled backend**, and
 * its result is cached and replayed to every client that connects later, so the
 * legend every tab in a root sees is the one negotiated by whichever tab
 * happened to open first. At least two servers compute their advertised legend
 * *from* the declared block — terraform-ls intersects its token types against
 * the client's array, and ocaml-lsp returns no provider at all unless the client
 * declares `formats: ['relative']` and `requests.full`. So a block that varied
 * per tab, per document or per viewport would make the whole root's colour
 * depend on which file someone opened first. Keyed on the server id it cannot:
 * the pool key is the server id plus the root, so every client of one backend
 * shares one id and therefore one byte-identical block.
 *
 * That is also why `lsp.semanticTokens.enabled` is **not** read here. It gates
 * requests, one layer up. Reading it at capability-build time would make the
 * declared block a function of when a tab opened, which is the same defect in a
 * different disguise.
 *
 * Three flags are absent rather than `false`, and the absence is the statement:
 *
 * - `multilineTokenSupport` — this app does not declare it yet, so no conformant
 *   server sends a token crossing a newline. The editor's builder will accept
 *   the flag; turning it on here is one line and one look at a real file.
 * - `overlappingTokenSupport` — the editor truncates the earlier of two
 *   overlapping spans rather than layering them, so claiming it would invite a
 *   server to send overlaps on a promise nothing keeps. The builder offers no
 *   way to declare it.
 * - `dynamicRegistration` — `deno`, `dart` and `tinymist` answer `initialize`
 *   with *no* provider when a client declares it, expecting to register later
 *   through `client/registerCapability`; this proxy answers that request `null`
 *   itself and forwards nothing, so the registration would never arrive and a
 *   working server would go silent.
