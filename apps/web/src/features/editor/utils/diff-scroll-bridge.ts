/**
 * Reports where a pane has scrolled to, so the host can mirror it onto the other one.
 *
 * Split-pane scroll sync is host work: `EditorViewContributionContext.setScrollTop` is
 * vertical-only, and a diff has to mirror both axes, which only `Editor.setScrollPosition` can do.
 * Getting the pane's position out promptly AND correctly takes both halves below, and neither
 * alone is enough.
 *
 * **Why not read the scroll element.** The virtualizer redefines `scrollTop` on it to return its
 * own logical offset, and folds a scroll into that offset in a `requestAnimationFrame` it schedules
 * from the very same event — so a `scroll` listener reading the element sees the offset from before
 * the scroll it is being told about. `Editor.getScrollPosition()` reads the same field and is stale
 * in the same way. A mirror driven from either is a frame behind and, worse, misses entirely any
 * gesture whose whole delta lands in one event.
 *
 * **Why not the `update` hook alone.** It carries the folded offset and is the authoritative
 * signal, but it is deliberately throttled: `shouldEmitImmediately` suppresses a scroll frame whose
 * mounted row window does not change, deferring to one trailing emit "once scrolling stops"
 * (fixedRowVirtualizer.ts). Measured against a real wheel, that left the mirror **seven frames**
 * behind the pane being driven — which is the jank.
 *
 * So: the `scroll` event for promptness, one rAF later for correctness. The virtualizer registers
 * its own listener when the scroll element is attached, before any plugin exists, so its fold is
 * scheduled first and has already run by the time ours does. `getSnapshot()` builds a fresh
 * snapshot per call (`Editor.createViewSnapshot`), so what we read there is the folded truth, one
 * frame after the scroll rather than a hundred milliseconds after it stops.
