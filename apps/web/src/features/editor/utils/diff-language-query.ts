 * The diff opens both of its texts as documents of its own, so the copy the server holds for a side
 * is normally the text this map was built from. That is a stronger guarantee than this gate used to
 * make: it previously borrowed some editor's document, which was correct but refused whenever no
 * editor happened to have the file open — the normal case while reading a diff.
 *
 * Two things are still worth refusing. A row may be no line of either text: placeholders,
 * separators and rows the projection blanked. And the one document the diff does not exclusively
 * own — the new side, when it shares the file's real uri — can drift out from under it. The drift
 * check is the one VS Code raised and dropped as racy (microsoft/vscode#34034); the raciness
 * objection was to doing it ONCE at load. Done per request there is no window: either the texts are
 * equal at the moment of asking, or we do not ask.
