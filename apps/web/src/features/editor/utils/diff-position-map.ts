 * permanently no-opping "Go to definition" on `git:` documents for nine years
 * (microsoft/vscode#324356), and Zed guards deleted-hunk positions in `completions.rs` and
 * `code_actions.rs` while missing hover and go-to-definition. Both enumerated call sites by hand.
 * This type is the chokepoint neither of them had.

/**
 * Translates between the diff's buffer and the two texts it is drawing.
 *
 * The buffer a diff editor holds is `joinRenderLines(rows)` — the two sides interleaved, plus
 * separator rows carrying a label and placeholder rows carrying nothing. So buffer line N is not
 * file line N, and anything position-based talking to a language server has to come through here.
 *
 * A row is resolved against the NEW text first and the old text second, so an unchanged line —
 * which carries both numbers — is answered about the file that still exists. Only a deletion ends
 * up on the old side.
 *
 * Three kinds of row stand for no line at all, and the third is the one worth naming:
 *
 * - placeholders, which pad the short side of a change block and stand for nothing;
 * - separators, whose text is the `Show N unmodified lines` label;
 * - a row whose text the projection BLANKED. `renderLineText` empties any line that looks like a
 *   raw hunk header, so a file that itself contains `@@ -1,2 +3,4 @@` projects an empty row while
 *   the file line has content. Its line number is honest and its columns are not.
 *
 * The third is caught by comparing each row against the line it claims, which also covers any
 * future divergence between projection and file without this needing to know about it. That check
 * needs the whole text; a partial diff carries none, and then nothing maps — which is correct,
 * because a patch-only diff is not the file.
