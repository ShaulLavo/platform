/**
 * The two documents a diff opens, and the names it opens them under.
 *
 * The new side takes the file's REAL uri wherever that is safe, because it is the same text the
 * file has and a language server that knows it by its real name resolves its imports, applies the
 * project's `paths`, and reports the same diagnostics an editor would. That is what VS Code gets by
 * handing the modified side the very `ITextModel` the editor holds.
 *
 * "Wherever that is safe" is one condition: our proxy forwards a joining client's text to the
 * backend when it DIFFERS from the shared copy, so opening the real uri with text that is not what
 * an editor already holds would repoint that editor's document. A diff of a historical commit, or
 * of a file with unsaved edits, is exactly that case — and it falls back to a phantom name.
 *
 * The old side is always a phantom: its text exists in git and nowhere on disk, so there is no real
 * uri it could honestly claim.
 *
 * A phantom is a SIBLING — same directory, same extension — rather than another scheme, and that is
 * the whole trick. `tsconfig` includes `src` as a wildcard directory, so an in-memory file beside
 * its original joins the same configured project and resolves `./relative` and `@/aliased` imports
 * identically. A `git:`-style scheme, which is what VS Code gives its original side, lands outside
 * every project and is why language features there have always been thin.
