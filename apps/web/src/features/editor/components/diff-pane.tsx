/**
 * One side of a diff: a real read-only `Editor` holding a synthetic buffer of the projected rows,
 * with the diff plugin supplying the rows, the gutter and the expansion clicks.
 *
 * `editor-diff-pane` and its `-${side}` suffix are stamped here rather than by the package. Both
 * are read: the bare class is how the git line-comment layer resolves which pane a row element
 * belongs to, and the suffix is how it names the side. Dropping either breaks side detection even
 * though nothing renders differently.
