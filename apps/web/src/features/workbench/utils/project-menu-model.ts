 * What the project menu offers, most recent first. Two sources, because neither

 * workspace root, and the orchestration projects cover ones that only ever
 * existed as a chat project, which was never opened here and so has no
 * last-opened stamp of its own.
 *
 * Order is load-bearing and comes from each source, since they have no shared
 * clock: recents arrive last-opened first, and projects arrive oldest-first from
 * the shell snapshot, so they are reversed onto the tail. Never-opened trails
 * ever-opened, which is the honest reading of "recent" for a menu that swaps the
 * workspace root.
 *
 * The open root is always first so the menu can never contradict the title
 * sitting next to it, even before either source has loaded.
