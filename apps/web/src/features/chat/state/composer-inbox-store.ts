 * usually is no composer: the terminal is right-clicked while the workbench
 * sidebar is on Files, so `ChatInput` only mounts once the reveal that follows
 * switches the tab. That is also why the reference's `composerHandleContext`
 * shape does not transfer — a ref to a component that is not mounted is null.

 * Two entry kinds, because capture surfaces produce two different things: a
 * chip that rides beside the prompt, and text that belongs in it.
