 * The one action a capture surface anywhere in the app calls to put something in

 *
 * Narrow on purpose: surfaces hand over *what* they captured and nothing else.
 * They do not learn which session is open, they do not touch the draft store, and
 * they never hold a reference to the editor — which is what stops each new
 * capture surface growing a handle of its own.
