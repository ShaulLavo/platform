 *   not per provider: this list is flat, unlike the picker, which groups by
 *   provider and so ranks within each group.
 * - then the provider catalogue, which is what makes the section usable at all.
 *   Deriving rows from `hidden`/`order` alone meant the list could only contain
 *   models the user had already acted on, so it started empty and stayed empty.
 * - then anything left in `preferences.hidden`. A model whose provider has
 *   stopped reporting it is absent from the catalogue, and without this pass it
 *   would lose its row while staying hidden — permanently, with nothing left in
 *   the UI able to bring it back.
 *
 * `options` must be the *unfiltered* catalogue. Hiding is a flag here, never a
 * subtraction, because hiding is the decision this screen exists to take back.
