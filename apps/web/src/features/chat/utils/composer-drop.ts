 * What a drag carries, as far as the composer is concerned.

 * absolute path — it is a generic tree component and knows nothing about chat,
 * so there is no chat-specific MIME type to look for. The composer identifies
 * the drop by its content instead: a single-line absolute path inside the open
 * workspace is a file the user pointed at, and becomes a mention. Anything else
 * is text, and the editor's own drop handling keeps it.
