 * three telemetry dialects, so a dashboard over `command.dispatchAcceptedCount`
 * missed every chat-mode action and a grep over `action:"chat.session.*"` missed
 * every chat-view command. Worse, writing the envelope by hand cost enough that
 * four more call sites skipped error handling entirely and dispatched into
 * `void`. One entry point is what makes the telemetry uniform and the rejection
 * boundary free.
 *
 * Never rejects. Every hook it calls is guarded, so `void dispatchChatCommand({…})`
 * is a real rejection boundary — which `void transport.dispatchCommand(…)` was not.
