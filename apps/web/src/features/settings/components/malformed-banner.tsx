/**
 * Says that a settings file cannot be parsed, and that it does not matter yet.
 *
 * Without this the state is invisible and contradictory: the page shows every
 * value at whatever is in force, the file on disk says something else, and every
 * write is refused with a typed error nobody asked for. The server holds the last
 * values that parsed precisely so the app keeps working through a hand-edit —
 * this is the part that tells the user their edit has not taken effect, which is
 * the one thing retention would otherwise hide.
 *
 * Separate from `DiagnosticsBanner` and louder: a diagnostic is one entry that
 * did not apply, this is a whole file that did not.
