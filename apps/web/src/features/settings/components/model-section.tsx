/**
 * The model list, as the single control over both `models.hidden` and `models.order`.
 *
 * One list, two keys, one row on the page. Hiding and ranking are the same
 * decision taken about the same model, and rendering them as two settings meant
 * printing the whole catalogue twice and asking the user to match a switch in
 * the first copy to a pair of arrows in the second.
 *
 * The catalogue is read *unfiltered* — no preferences are passed to
 * `providerModelOptions`, whose job in the picker is to subtract the hidden
 * models. Subtracting them here would mean the switch that hides a model also
 * removes the row holding it, leaving no way to bring it back from the one
 * screen built to do that. `modelPreferenceRows` applies `hidden` as a flag
 * instead, which is what this screen exists to toggle.
