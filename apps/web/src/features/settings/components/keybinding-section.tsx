 * Every bindable command, as the single control over `keybindings.overrides`.

 * The rows are read back out of the *resolved* table rather than off the
 * override document, so the list says what is in force rather than what was
 * asked for — including a command whose chord another command's override took.
 * The search box is not optional at ~90 rows: without it the only way to reach
 * a command is to scroll a list sorted by nothing the user chose.
