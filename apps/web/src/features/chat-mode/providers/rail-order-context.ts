 * Dropping a row is an app-level command — it mints an order key and dispatches
 * — so the rail's rows reach it through here instead of being handed a callback
 * down through the bands they live in.
 *
 * The ids are the raw drag ids: dnd-kit reports what was dragged and what it was
 * released over, and resolving those against the list is the action's own job.
