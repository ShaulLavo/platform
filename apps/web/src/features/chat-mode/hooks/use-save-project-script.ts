 * Promotes a script the user actually ran into the project's saved list.

 * Without a writer, `project.scripts` could only ever be empty and the palette's
 * "Project Scripts" group was permanently dead UI. This is the cheapest honest
 * writer: the list becomes "the commands you run in this project", which is
 * useful on its own and needs no editor to exist first.
 *
 * Deliberately not silent about ordering — a re-run moves the script to the
 * front, so the group reads most-recent-first and the thing you keep running is
 * the thing at the top.
