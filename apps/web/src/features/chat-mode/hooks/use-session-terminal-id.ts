 * belonged to whichever session opened it first. That is wrong for two reasons
 * — a session's terminal should be sitting in that session's checkout, and a
 * long-running command started for one task should not appear to belong to the
 * next one.
 *
 * The server keys PTYs by this id (`terminal/service.ts`), so a stable id per
 * session is also what lets a shell survive switching away and back.
