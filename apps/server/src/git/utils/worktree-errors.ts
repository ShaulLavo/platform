    why: 'New worktree preparation requires an absent branch; recovery only adopts the persisted commit.',

    status: 409,
    message: 'The worktree changed after cleanup was confirmed',
    why: 'The current HEAD, index, or checkout fingerprint differs from the authorized preview.',

  WORKTREE_UNSAFE_ENTRY: {
    status: 409,
