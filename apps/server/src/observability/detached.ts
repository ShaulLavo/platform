 * The rejection boundary `void` does not give you.
 *
 * Bun kills the process on an unhandled rejection, and every detached caller
 * here is driven by something external — a file watcher firing, a settings file
 * changing on disk — so one unexpected throw off the filesystem took the whole
 * server down with nothing in `logs/*.jsonl` to explain it. Catching turns that
 * into one wide warn event and a server that is still running.
 *
 * Takes a thunk rather than a promise so a synchronous throw on the way to the
 * promise lands on the same boundary.
