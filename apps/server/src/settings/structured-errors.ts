 * Settings failures the client has to branch on.
 *
 * Each one is a different answer to "why did my save not take": the value was
 * wrong, the key does not exist, the layer may not carry it, the file is broken,
 * someone else edited it, or an administrator owns it. Collapsing them into one
 * generic failure is what makes a settings page feel haunted.

    why: 'The write named a setting this build does not register. Reads keep unknown keys so another build’s settings survive, but a write has to name something real.',
    fix: 'Check the key against the settings registry. A renamed setting keeps its old value in the file until it is removed explicitly.',

  SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED: {
