 * shutdown ordering and would fire inside every test in the suite, for a
 * reclaim nobody is waiting on — an idle machine has nothing to lose by holding
 * a process until it is next asked to start one.
 *
 * Safety rests entirely on the liveness stamp: `lastSeenAt` moves with the
 * provider's own event stream, not just with status transitions, so a session
 * doing long background work reads as recently seen even though its status has
 * not changed in an hour. Without that feed this class would kill live work,
 * which is why it must never be pointed at a directory that is not being fed.
