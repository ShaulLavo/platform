# Repository Guidelines

## Code Organization

- Group by feature, then by kind:
  - `components/` — React render components only (`.tsx`)
  - `hooks/` — `use-*` hooks
  - `providers/` — context providers and `*-context.ts` modules
  - `state/` — optional home for stores and other stateful modules. Co-locating a store next to its provider is fine too
  - `utils/` — pure, stateless, non-React code only. No stores, no module-level mutable state, no subscriptions, nothing that imports React
  - `tests/` — feature tests
- Do not create empty folders.
- Import exact files through `@/`. Do not add barrel `index.ts` files.
- Barrel files are allowed only at package entry points such as `packages/*/src/index.ts` that back the package's `"."` export. Do not add feature, folder, or utility barrels.
- `apps/web/src/lib/` is the app-level shared layer. It is not a kind directory and it is not a junk drawer. **A module belongs in `lib/` only if two or more consumers outside `lib/` import it** — counting `features/*` (each feature counts once), `components/`, `hooks/`, `keymap/`, and `main.tsx` — **or if it is a dependency of a `lib/` module that qualifies.** A module with a single outside consumer lives inside that consumer instead.
- The rule runs both ways. When a `lib/` module drops to one consumer, move it into that consumer. When a feature-local module gains a second feature consumer, move it up to `lib/` in the same pass — do not import across features to reach it.
- `lib/` sits below `features/`: a `lib/` module should not import from `@/features/*`. Shared policy that genuinely needs feature knowledge belongs in the layer that already owns the domain — command enablement lives in `keymap/`, next to the command registry, not in `lib/` and not in `components/`.
- Two implementations of the same-sounding helper are not automatically duplicates. Before merging them, diff their _behaviour_ — the six `basename` variants in `apps/web/src` have three different empty-path fallbacks (`'Root'`, `''`, and the whole path) and one of them lowercases its result, yet all six share the signature `(string) => string`, so a wrong merge typechecks. Merge only with a test per call site, or leave a comment saying why they differ.

## Control Flow

- The `never-nester` skill is part of every development task: `/Users/shaul/.agents/skills/never-nester/SKILL.md`.
- Keep nesting depth to 3 or less.
- Use guard clauses and early returns. Keep the happy path shallow.
- In loops, use inverted conditions with `continue` instead of wrapping the body in `if`.
- Extract inner logic into named functions when inversion is not enough.
- Do not use `else` after an early return.
- Never use nested ternaries. Split the logic into `if` statements or a named helper.

## Comments

- Keep comments short. One or two lines. Three is already suspicious.
- A comment earns its place by saying what the code cannot: a non-obvious constraint, the bug it prevents, why an obvious simplification is wrong. Everything else is noise.
- No essays, no history lessons, no restating the next line in prose. If the explanation is long, the code or the name is wrong.

## React Code

- One component per file. Do not export multiple components from one component file.
- One hook per file. Keep hook files focused on the hook and its React wiring.
- Keep pure helpers out of component and hook files. Move formatters, transforms, constants, models, and other pure reusable logic into `utils/`.
- Stores are stateful, so they never go in `utils/`. Where they do live is flexible: `state/`, or co-located with the provider or feature code that owns them.
- Keep providers and context-object modules in `providers/`, not `components/`.
- Do not prop-drill app-level commands, state setters, or callbacks through layout/presentation components. If a prop is only forwarded, or a command crosses more than two component boundaries, stop and add a narrow feature provider/hook or colocate the command with the state owner.
- Keep leaf callbacks as props only when they are local UI behavior owned by the direct parent. Context/provider APIs should expose small domain actions such as `selectTab` or `requestCloseTab`, not broad state blobs.
- Avoid manual React memoization. Do not add `memo`, `useMemo`, or `useCallback` for ordinary render values or callbacks. Use them only for measured performance issues, required stable identity, or correctness. Add a short reason when you do.

## Styling

- Style with Tailwind classes and the `@workspace/ui` primitives. Do not write raw CSS or inline `style` props except for values that must be computed at runtime (dynamic positions, measured sizes).
- Use theme tokens only. Color classes must resolve to a token: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `bg-card`, `border-border`, etc.
- Never use raw Tailwind palette colors (`bg-blue-600`, `text-red-500`, `text-sky-300`, `amber-*`, `emerald-*`) or hex/`oklch()` literals in components. They bypass theming and dark mode.
- Status and diff colors have tokens — use them instead of picking a palette hue:
  - error / danger → `destructive`
  - info / primary action → `info`
  - success / passed → `success`
  - warning / degraded → `warning`
  - diff added / removed → `diff-added` / `diff-removed`
- These tokens flip automatically between light and dark. Do not hand-roll dark variants like `text-sky-700 dark:text-sky-300`; write `text-info` once.
- A token works with opacity and every utility: `bg-success/10`, `border-warning/30`, `ring-info`.
- Need a color with no token? Add it to `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css` (light `:root`, `.dark`, and the `@theme inline` map) instead of inlining a palette class.
- Compose the shared primitives; do not restyle them ad-hoc or reach for a raw `<button>`/`<input>` when a primitive exists.
- Surface material is built into the theme: `bg-background`, `bg-card`, `bg-popover`, `bg-muted`, `bg-accent` are already translucent via `--surface-opacity`. Never hand-roll material with `/NN` opacity modifiers or ad-hoc `backdrop-blur-*` on a surface.
- Two material utilities, pick by what is behind the surface:
  - `backdrop-material` — honest glass (blur + saturate via `--surface-blur`/`--surface-saturation`) for surfaces that sit on the wallpaper or real content: window frames, sidebars, in-pane chrome.
  - `surface-vibrancy` — macOS-style vibrancy for floating surfaces (dialogs, menus, popovers, toasts): backdrop blur for content ghosting, plus the semi-transparent pre-blurred wallpaper (`--surface-wallpaper`) under a popover tint so color survives even over a white pane. Self-contained — do not also paint `bg-popover` on the element; that stacks a fourth layer and goes opaque.
- Opaque-on-purpose surfaces use the `-solid` utilities (`bg-background-solid`, `bg-card-solid`, ...). They deliberately ignore the user's transparency setting — use them for things that must never fade (e.g. switch thumbs, active tab fills).
- Regenerate `apps/web/public/workbench/wallpaper-vibrancy.png` (blur 48px, saturate 160%, 35% opacity baked into the alpha channel, ~1280px wide) whenever the wallpaper image changes. Keep the alpha low — it is a color cast; higher values drown the backdrop ghosting.

## Settings

- Every user-facing knob is a registry entry in `packages/contracts/src/settings/keys.ts`. Never a new `localStorage` key, never a new env var, never a hardcoded constant someone has to recompile to change.
- A key is never registered inert. Register it in the same pass that wires its consumer, or do not register it — a knob that writes a file nothing reads is worse than no knob.
- Scope is a security boundary. A value that reaches **execution** — selects a binary, sets env, becomes a flag name, or binds a key — is `application` or `machine`, never `window`: a workspace file ships inside a cloned repository. A value that reaches only **suppression** may be `window`, and then it must show the cross-scope indicator.
- Settings are read through `useSettingValue` in React, or `readSettingsMirror()` outside it (module scope, async generators). Do not reach into the query cache directly.
- Secrets never enter the settings document. They go to the secret store, which is why the raw JSON view, export and the settings file itself are safe to read.
- Regenerate `docs/settings-reference.md` with `bun run settings:reference` after changing the registry.

## Greenfield, No Backward Compatibility

- This project is greenfield and not live: no releases, no external users, no data anyone needs migrated.
- No backward compatibility shims, no legacy aliases, no deprecation windows. Update every call site in the same pass.
- When a bug fix invalidates state the buggy code already persisted (localStorage, caches, on-disk files), do not write healing or migration code. Delete the bad state, or tell the user what to delete. One corrupted dev machine never justifies permanent code.

## Naming And Refactors

- Do not repeat the folder name in file or symbol names. In `workspace/`, prefer `sidebar.tsx`, not `workspace-sidebar.tsx`.
- Keep qualifiers only when they add meaning: domain types like `WorkspaceCommand`, domain terms like `workspacePath`, or root components like `WorkspaceView`.
- When removing a redundant prefix, rename the file, exports, and all call sites in one pass.
- Delete obsolete tests instead of preserving old behavior.
- Remove duplicate code aggressively.

## Optimization And Performance Work

- Look beyond the local minimum. Before tuning an implementation, ask whether the data layout, algorithm, or overall design is the real bottleneck. Challenging the frame beats polishing it.
- Tweak-level wins (caching a value, hoisting a loop, batching calls) are easy to find and easy to overrate. Treat them as a floor, not the goal.
- Question the expensive work's right to exist: can allocations be eliminated instead of pooled, can the computation be done once instead of cached, can the layer be deleted instead of sped up?
- State the structural alternative even when only asked for a quick optimization. If a redesign would beat every local tweak, say so before spending effort on tweaks.
- Measure before and after. An optimization without a benchmark or profile is a guess.
- Aim for the domain-expert ceiling, not the first improvement that works: zero allocations, no redundant passes, data shaped for how it is actually accessed.

## Debugging

- Calibrate the instrument before trusting its readings. Before debugging "X isn't happening", first confirm X would be observable if it did happen — e.g. before chasing a highlight that "doesn't paint", check what color it is supposed to paint and that the color is distinguishable from the background. Verify the expected observable on a known-good case as a control.
- Treat contradictions as falsification, not as detail to patch around. When a theory needs a new special case after each new observation (per-object, then per-node, then per-row, then global), the theory is wrong — stop patching it, go back to raw ground truth, and re-derive. Two epicycles is the limit.

## Logs

- The app writes structured JSONL logs to `logs/`, one file per day (`logs/2026-06-12.jsonl`). Days that grow too big roll over into numbered continuations (`2026-06-12.1.jsonl`); the highest number is the newest.
- Each line is one JSON object with `timestamp`, `level` (`debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`), and `source` (`be` = server, `client` = web app, `keyboard`), plus request/operation fields like `requestId` and `area`. Filter with `grep`/`jq` instead of reading raw.
- Looking at the logs is highly encouraged for any task. When debugging, it is a must — check them before forming a theory.
- If the logs do not explain the failure, that is itself the bug to fix first: add the missing log events or fields, then debug with the better logs. Do not debug blind.
- Logging is wide-event style (evlog). Always prefer wide logs: enrich the one event per operation/request with more fields instead of emitting extra narrow log lines.
- Never throw `new Error`. Create errors with `createError` from `evlog` — in practice through the feature's `structured-errors.ts` wrapper (`createStructuredError` or a `defineErrorCatalog` entry) so the error carries `code`, `status`, `why`, and `fix`.

## TypeScript Fixes

- Treat readonly/mutable mismatches as contract bugs first.
- Do not copy containers just to satisfy TypeScript.
- If a callee does not mutate a value, make its parameter or model type accept readonly data.
- Avoid fake fixes like `sizes: [...node.sizes]`. Copy only for a real ownership boundary or real mutation.

## Dev Server

- A dev server is always running. Never spin up your own server to test or verify changes — reuse the running one.

## Testing

- Tests run on Vitest.
- Apps run under Bun: `bun --bun vitest`.
- Runtime-neutral `packages/*` run plain `vitest`.
- Use these environments, in this order of preference: real browser, happy-dom, never jsdom.
- Test projects:
  - `node` — pure logic and in-process server tests. Runs under `--bun`.
  - `dom` — hook and component tests in happy-dom. Runs under `--bun`.
  - `browser` — real layout/paint `*.browser.tsx` tests via Playwright. Runs under plain Node because Vitest browser orchestration breaks under `--bun`.
- In `apps/web` the browser world lives in its own `vitest.browser.config.ts`. Vitest merges Vite-level options such as `define` across the projects of one config file, so a `define` written for the browser project silently rewrites the same constant for `node` and `dom`. Keep the two files separate.
- The `--bun` flag is required for app tests. Without it, `bun:sqlite`, `Bun.spawn`, and other Bun APIs do not resolve. Coverage is the only casualty; we do not use it.

### Use Real App Code

- Import `{ test, expect }` from `apps/web/test/fixtures.ts`, not from `vitest`, for app tests.
- Drive the real in-process Elysia server. The `server` fixture builds `createApp` over a temp workspace. The `client` fixture is a real `treaty` client wired to `app.handle`.
- Do not `mock.module` or `vi.mock` our server, client, or feature modules.
- Production code calls `getClient()` from `@/lib/client`. Tests inject the real client with `setClient`, and restore whatever was installed before rather than resetting to a default — the `dom` project installs a real in-process client for every file in `test/env/dom.ts`, so a reset would hand later tests in the file a socket.
- No test may open a socket to our own server. MSW runs with `onUnhandledRequest: 'error'`, so an escape fails the test that caused it instead of printing a bare `ECONNREFUSED` from Bun's http client.
- Build real state. For example, `git init` a temp repo and write real files, then assert through real routes.

### Mock Boundaries Only

- Mock only the outside world and unspawnable processes.
- Use MSW or injected `fetcher`s for third-party HTTP. Set `onUnhandledRequest: 'error'`.
- Use injectable factories for PTY and LSP child processes.
- Mock serialization edges a real server cannot reproduce, such as Eden `Date` normalization.
- `MockProviderAdapter` is a production adapter, not a test stub. Prefer it over the real Codex adapter, which spawns an external binary.
- Browser tests cannot import the Bun-native server into Node. Spawn the real server as a child `bun` process behind the Vite proxy in `apps/web/test/env/browser-file-server.ts`.
- Node and dom tests import the server in-process.

### Test Hygiene

- Shared test code lives under `test/`.
- Use `fixtures.ts` for `test.extend`.
- Use `render.tsx`; `renderWithProviders` mirrors the app's `main.tsx` provider stack.
- Put shared builders in `test/factories/`.
- Put environment and MSW setup in `test/env/` and `test/msw/`.
- Do not redefine per-file factories.
- Do not hand-roll provider trees.
- Avoid import-time nondeterminism, such as `Math.random()` at module scope. Use deterministic or seedable ids.

### Bun/Vitest Gotchas

- Under Vitest transforms, `import.meta.path` and `import.meta.dir` are `undefined`. `import.meta.dirname` works. Avoid Bun-only `import.meta` fields in code that tests must drive.
- Cold process-spawning tests can exceed Vitest's 5s default timeout. If CI flakes cold, raise `testTimeout` for that project.
- The node-pty bridge must spawn the real Node binary, not Bun's `--bun` node shim.
- Under `bun --bun`, Bun prepends a temp `node` symlink to `PATH`. `Bun.spawn(['node', ...])` then runs Bun, and `@lydell/node-pty` breaks with `this._socket.write is not a function`.
- Use `resolveNodeBinary()` in `terminal/service.ts`; it walks `PATH` and skips Bun-backed `node`. Production plain `bun` already resolves `node` correctly, but this protects tests.

`tabular-nums` should be the default for any number that updates ( timers, counters, prices, percentages, scores, live data etc ).

you can enable this tnum OpenType feature using the CSS property `font-variant-numeric`.

.tabular-nums {
font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
}
