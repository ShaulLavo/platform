/**
 * The shared contract for "this is still fetching". Features supply the visual
 * structure that matches their loaded content; this shell owns the accessible
 * status and the delay that prevents fast requests from flashing placeholders.
 *
 * `label` is the accessible name only — nothing is drawn for it.
 *
 * The busy container mounts immediately so assistive tech is told right away;
 * only the visual preview waits out `delayMs`, which keeps a fast query from
 * flashing placeholder content.
